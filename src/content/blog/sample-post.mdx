This is a sample blog post in **MDX**. You can use Markdown and JSX.

## Code block with syntax highlighting

Here is a short code snippet that will be highlighted:

```ts
function estimateReadingTime(body: string): number {
  const wordsPerMinute = 200;
  const wordCount = body.split(/\s+/).length;
  return Math.max(1, Math.ceil(wordCount / wordsPerMinute));
}
```

## Lists and structure

- Research workflows benefit from static sites.
- Astro keeps the site fast and content in Markdown/MDX.
- Netlify provides one-click deploy and optional forms.

Replace this file with your own posts in `src/content/blog/`. Use the same frontmatter fields: `title`, `description`, `publishDate`, `tags`, and optionally `author` and `draft`.
