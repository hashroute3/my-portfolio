# Company logos (Experience section)

- **Slack:** The site uses `slack.png`. To use the logo from [Slack’s LinkedIn company page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tiny-spec-inc), open that page, right‑click the Slack logo, choose **Save image as…**, and save it here as **`slack.png`** (overwriting the existing file).
- Other logos are downloaded by `node scripts/download-logos.mjs` (Wikimedia SVGs or favicon PNGs).
